## What is Helm ?
Helm is a packager for Kubernetes that bundles related manifest files and packages them into a single logical deployment unit: Chart. Simplified, for many engineers Helm makes it easy to start using Kubernetes with real applications.

## What is Helm Chart ?
A Helm chart is a package that contains all the necessary resources to deploy an application to a Kubernetes cluster. This includes YAML configuration files for deployments, services, secrets, and config maps that define the desired state of your application.

## What is Helm release ?
A Release is an instance of a chart running in a Kubernetes cluster. One chart can often be installed many times into the same cluster.
## What is Helm repo ?
At a high level, a chart repository is where packaged charts can be stored and shared.
