## Kubernetes Overview

Kubernetes or k8s is an open-source orchestration and cluster management for container-based applications maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation.<br>
Kubernetes is an open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.<br>
It groups containers that make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery
## Kubernetes Architecture & Components
 - Managed Kubernetes Cluster (We do not have on control Plane) e.g
    - AKS on Azure Cloud
    - EKS on AWS cloud
    - GKE on Google Cloud
 - Self Managed kubernetes Cluster (Installed on VMs)
### Kubernetes has two type of nodes
- Master Nodes (Control Plane)
- Worker Nodes 
### Control Plane
The control plane is responsible for container orchestration and maintaining the desired state of the cluster. It has the following components. 
- kube-apiserver
- etcd
- kube-scheduler
- kube-controller-manager
- cloud-controller-manager

### Worker Node
The Worker nodes are responsible for running containerized applications. The worker Node has the following components.

- kubelet
- kube-proxy
- Container runtime
### Control Plane Components:
#### kube-apiserver
- The kube-api server is the central hub of the Kubernetes cluster that exposes the Kubernetes API.<br>
- End users, and other cluster components, talk to the cluster via the API server.<br>
- So when you use kubectl to manage the cluster, at the backend you are actually communicating with the API server through HTTP REST APIs.<br>
- The communication between the API server and other components in the cluster happens over TLS to prevent unauthorized access to the cluster.<br>
- It is the only component that communicates with etcd.<br>

####  etcd
- etcd is an open-source strongly consistent, distributed key-value store.
- etcd is designed to run on multiple nodes as a cluster without sacrificing consistency.
- etcd stores all configurations, states, and metadata of Kubernetes objects (pods, secrets, daemonsets, deployments, configmaps, statefulsets, etc).
- etcd it is the only Statefulset component in the control plane.
- Only kube-apiserver can talk to etcd.

#### kube-scheduler:
- The kube-scheduler is responsible for scheduling Kubernetes pods on worker nodes.
- It is a controller that listens to pod creation events in the API server.
- The scheduler has two phases. Scheduling cycle and the Binding cycle. Together it is called the scheduling context. The scheduling cycle selects a worker node and the binding cycle applies that change to the cluster.

#### Kube Controller Manager
- Controllers are programs that run infinite control loops. Meaning it runs continuously and watches the actual and desired state of objects.
- Kube controller manager is a component that manages all the Kubernetes controllers. Kubernetes resources/objects like pods, namespaces, jobs, replicaset are managed by respective controllers. 
- the Kube scheduler is also a controller managed by the Kube controller manager.
#####  built-in Kubernetes controllers.
- Deployment controller
- Replicaset controller
- DaemonSet controller 
- Job Controller (Kubernetes Jobs)
- CronJob Controller
- endpoints controller
- namespace controller
- service accounts controller.
- Node controller
###  Cloud Controller Manager (CCM)
- When kubernetes is deployed in cloud environments, the cloud controller manager acts as a bridge between Cloud Platform APIs and the Kubernetes cluster.
- Cloud controller integration allows Kubernetes cluster to provision cloud resources like instances (for nodes), Load Balancers (for services), and Storage Volumes (for persistent volumes).<br>

   <span style="color:orange;">3 main controllers that are part of the cloud controller manager.</span>


- **Node controller:** This controller updates node-related information by talking to the cloud provider API. For example, node labeling & annotation, getting hostname, CPU & memory availability, nodes health, etc.
- **Route controller:** It is responsible for configuring networking routes on a cloud platform. So that pods in different nodes can talk to each other.
- **Service controller**: It takes care of deploying load balancers for kubernetes services, assigning IP addresses, etc.

### Kubernetes Worker Node Components
####  Kubelet
- Kubelet is an agent component that runs on every node in the cluster.
- It does not run as a container instead runs as a daemon, managed by systemd.
- It is responsible for registering worker nodes with the API server.
- It then brings the podSpec to the desired state by creating containers.
- Creating, modifying, and deleting containers for the pod.
- Responsible for handling liveliness, readiness, and startup probes.
Responsible for Mounting volumes by reading pod configuration and creating respective directories on the host for the volume mount.
- Kubelet is also a controller that watches for pod changes and utilizes the nodeâ€™s container runtime to pull images, run containers, etc.
- Static pods are controlled by kubelet, not the API servers.
- Static pods from podSpecs located at /etc/kubernetes/manifests

![Kubelet](/images/kubelet-architecture.png)

#### Kube proxy
- Kube-Proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in a Kubernetes cluster.
- It is responsible for maintaining network connectivity between services and pods.
- Kube-Proxy does this by translating service definitions into actionable networking rules.
- Kube-proxy uses iptables as a default mode.
#### Container Runtime
- Container runtime runs on all the nodes in the Kubernetes cluster. It is responsible for pulling images from container registries, running containers, allocating and isolating resources for containers, and managing the entire lifecycle of a container on a host.
- Kubernetes supports multiple container runtimes (CRI-O, Docker Engine, containerd, etc) that are compliant with Container Runtime Interface (CRI). This means, all these container runtimes implement the CRI interface and expose gRPC CRI APIs (runtime and image service endpoints).
![Container runtime](/images/containeruntime.png)

- When there is a new request for a pod from the API server, the kubelet talks to CRI-O daemon to launch the required containers via Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface.
- CRI-O checks and pulls the required container image from the configured container registry using containers/image library.
- CRI-O then generates OCI runtime specification (JSON) for a container.
- CRI-O then launches an OCI-compatible runtime (runc) to start the container process as per the runtime specification.
### Kubernetes Cluster Addon Components
- CNI Plugin (Container Network Interface)
- CoreDNS (For DNS server): CoreDNS acts as a DNS server within the Kubernetes cluster. By enabling this addon, you can enable DNS-based service discovery.
- Metrics Server (For Resource Metrics): This addon helps you collect performance data and resource usage of Nodes and pods in the cluster.
- Web UI (Kubernetes Dashboard): This addon enables the Kubernetes dashboard to manage the object via web UI.


## Virual Machine setup for Kubernetes Installation.
### Prerequisites
- Virtualbox installed on Windows vm.
- Internet connectivity has to be there.
- Vscode should be installed
- Gitbash should also be available on Windows machine

### Create two VMS using vagrant on virtualbox
- Create a folder in Windows OS 
- Open folder in vscode 
- Open Terminal in vscode and run the below commands
```yaml
 git clone https://gitlab.com/container-and-kubernetes/kubernetes-2024.git
 cd kubernetes-2024/two-vms
 vagrant up
```
- Check your virtualbox and see if you have two vms (kmaster & kworker1) with below ips
```t
kmaster: 172.16.16.100
kworker1: 172.16.16.101
```
- Try to login to each vms using the command below usinf vscode terminal

```t
ssh vagrant@172.16.16.100
ssh vagrant@172.16.16.101
```

## Kubernetes Cluster Setup Documentation

### Documentation Link:

https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/

### Installation of kubeadm ,kubelet etc will be done on master and worker nodes.
####  Setup containerd

#### Prerequisites
- A compatible Linux host.       
- 2 GB or more of RAM per machine (any less will leave little room for your apps).
- 2 CPUs or more.
- Full network connectivity between all machines in the cluster (public or private network is fine).
- Unique hostname, MAC address, and product_uuid for every node. See here for more details.
- Certain ports are open on your machines. See here for more details.
- Swap configuration. The default behavior of a kubelet was to fail to start if swap memory was detected on a node. 

- [ ] Verify the MAC address and product_uuid are unique for every node
```t
ip link 
ip addr show 
ifconfig -a
sudo cat /sys/class/dmi/id/product_uuid
```
- Check [Required Ports](https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/networking/ports-and-protocols/) 
```t
nc 127.0.0.1 6443
```
- Disable swap 

```t
sudo swapoff -a

sudo sed -i '/ swap / s/^\(.*\)$/#\1/g' /etc/fstab
```
### Installing a container runtime

   - To run containers in Pods, Kubernetes uses a container runtime.

   - By default, Kubernetes uses the Container Runtime Interface (CRI) to interface with your chosen container runtime.

   - If you don't specify a runtime, kubeadm automatically tries to detect an installed container runtime by scanning through a list of known **endpoints**.

   - If multiple or no **container runtimes** are detected kubeadm will throw an error and will request that you specify which one you want to use.
   - The tables below include the known endpoints for supported operating systems:
   - Runtime	Path to Unix domain socket
        | Container Runtime           | Socket                                    |
|-----------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| containerd                  | unix:///var/run/containerd/containerd.sock |
| CRI-O                       | unix:///var/run/crio/crio.sock            |
| Docker Engine (cri-dockerd) | unix:///var/run/cri-dockerd.sock          |
#### Install containerd
```sh
apt update -y
apt-get install -y containerd
mkdir -p /etc/containerd
containerd config default > /etc/containerd/config.toml
```
#### Update SystemdCgroup Settings 
```sh
sed -i 's/SystemdCgroup \= false/SystemdCgroup \= true/g' /etc/containerd/config.toml
```
#### Restart containerd
```sh
systemctl restart containerd
```

####  Kernel Parameter Configuration
- Forwarding IPv4 and letting iptables see bridged traffic
```t
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/modules-load.d/k8s.conf
overlay
br_netfilter
EOF

sudo modprobe overlay
sudo modprobe br_netfilter
```
- sysctl params required by setup, params persist across reboots
```t
cat <<EOF | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/k8s.conf
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-iptables  = 1
net.bridge.bridge-nf-call-ip6tables = 1
net.ipv4.ip_forward                 = 1
EOF
```
- Apply sysctl params without reboot
```t
sudo sysctl --system
```

### Kubernetes Cluster Configurations
- Static Pod Manifests: /etc/kubernetes/manifests
```t
/etc/kubernetes/manifests
  â”œâ”€â”€ etcd.yaml
  â”œâ”€â”€ kube-apiserver.yaml
  â”œâ”€â”€ kube-controller-manager.yaml
  â””â”€â”€ kube-scheduler.yaml
  ```
  - TLS Certificates <br>
  All the components talk to each other over mTLS. Under the PKI folder, you will find all the TLS certificates and keys
  ![](/images/tls.png)
  - Kubeconfig Files<br>
 - Any components that need to authenticate to the API server need the kubeconfig file.
  - All the cluster Kubeconfig files are present in the /etc/kubernetes folder (.conf files). You will find the following files.<br>

    - admin.conf
    - controller-manager.conf
    - kubelet.conf
    - scheduler.conf
  - It contains the API server endpoint, cluster CA certificate, cluster client certificate, and other information.<br>
 -  The admin.conf, file, which is the admin kubeconfig file used by end users to access the API server to manage the clusters.<br>
 -  The Kubeconfig for the Controller manager **controller-manager.conf**, scheduler, and Kubelet is used for API server authentication and authorization.
  ### Kubelet Configurations
  ```yaml
      kubelet kubeconfig file: /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf
      kubelet config file: /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml
      EnvironmentFile=-/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env
  ```
- The /var/lib/kubelet/config.yaml contains all the kubelet-related configurations. The static pod manifest location is added as part of the staticPodPath parameter.
/var/lib/kubelet/kubeadm-flags.env file contains the container runtime environment Linux socket and the infra container (pause container) image.

 ### What is a Kubeconfig file?
 - A Kubeconfig is a YAML file with all the Kubernetes cluster details, certificates, and secret tokens to authenticate the cluster. <br>
 - You might get this config file directly from the cluster administrator or from a cloud platform if you are using a managed Kubernetes cluster.
 - When you use kubectl, it uses the information in the kubeconfig file to connect to the kubernetes cluster API. The default location of the Kubeconfig file is $HOME/.kube/config
- Example Kubeconfig File
    - certificate-authority-data: Cluster CA
    - server: Cluster endpoint (IP/DNS of the master node)
    - name: Cluster name
    - user: name of the user/service account.
    - token: Secret token of the user/service account.
```t
apiVersion: v1
clusters:
- cluster:
    certificate-authority-data: <ca-data-here>
    server: https://your-k8s-cluster.com
  name: <cluster-name>
contexts:
- context:
    cluster:  <cluster-name>
    user:  <cluster-name-user>
  name:  <cluster-name>
current-context:  <cluster-name>
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name:  <cluster-name-user>
  user:
    token: <secret-token-here>
 ```
- List all cluster contexts
```t
kubectl config get-contexts -o=name
```
- Set the current context
```t
kubectl config use-context <cluster-name>  
```
- Using Environment variable (KUBECONFIG)
```t
export KUBECONFIG=<kubeconfig filename>
```
- Using Kubeconfig File With Kubectl
```t
kubectl get nodes --kubeconfig=<filepath>
```
- How to merge multiple kubeconfig into one 
```t
KUBECONFIG=config:dev_config:test_config kubectl config view --merge --flatten > config.new
